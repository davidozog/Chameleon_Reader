<h2 align="center"><font face="Arial">The Friday Night of Eugene Chinese Church</font></h2>  
<p align="justify">The Friday Night activity takes place in Eugene Chinese Christian Church, which has been the only Chinese church in Eugene/Springfield since 1980. Aiming at serving the local Chinese community and Chinese students from overseas, this activity has been held in every Friday night, which generally comprises of three parts---Potluck Dinner, Bible Study for Seekers and Worship Service. Since most of the attendees are Chinese students and scholars, the activity is in Chinese, Cantonese and English. This weekend activity usually starts at 5:30 pm, before which a worship service practice is held for making sure the event is effort-free.

<p align="justify"><b>The Setting </b></p> 
<p align="justify">The church's activity room in Friday night will be turned into a dining room that can hold around 40 adults. Before the potluck dinner, staffs put the long white tables together, end to end, and put the dished they had prepared on them. Most of the staffs are Chinese retired faculties who have been serving in the church for years; some of whom are young couples living in Eugene. The dishes including appetizer, soup, entree, dessert and other Chinese food are available to whoever attends the activity. After potluck dinner, attendees move to the worship place where the Bible Study for Seekers and the Worship Service are held, but on Jan. 7, since there was an American lecturer who speaks Chinese is invited to make speeches on the lectern, the time of Bible Study was cancelled..</p>

<p align="justify"><b>The Artifacts, Technology, and Systems </b></p> 
<p align="justify">Before the potluck dinner, some people help arrange wooden tables and metal chairs; some people help arrange dishes. As Fig 6 shows, on the table, there are many containers and tableware including plastic round pad, aluminum baking tray, iron tray, glass plate, deep aluminum pot, etc. More specifically, most of containers are used for hot food; some of those are used for snacks and fruits. There is a huge electric rice cooker supports enough white rice for everyone. Also disposable plates, forks, paper cups, and napkins are provided. People stand in line and put food into their plates with plastic clamps one after another.  </p> 
<p align="justify">In the worship section, staffs would give every newcomer a manual and a business card of Pastor Poon. In addition, newcomers will receive a personal contact information sheet handed from staffs, by which church can keep contact with these newcomers. During the worship, people sing together accompanying with people leading on the stage. Generally, two people sing on the stage with one guitar player, one keyboard player, one drummer, and one violinist. Under the JBL Audio System with dynamic microphones, the music sounds wonderful. Besides, in front of curtain, there is a projector which is used for showing lyrics of the carols. Moreover, during lecture, the speaker uses projector and curtain for showing his slides to illustrate his speech more clearly to every audience in the church.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>The Expectations</b></p> 
<p align="justify">Many Chinese students participate in the church evening activity with gratitude. They still remembered how relieved they feel when they received the furniture delivered from Eugene Chinese church after they went through the unfurnished crazy time. Now they find a new place to communicate with other local Chinese people for getting a better understanding about what is going on in the local community and even the state. Through the weekend activities particularly designed for Chinese students and scholars, many people find a new way to adjust themselves to the new life here in the US and Oregon. </p> 
<p align="justify">Even though the main purpose for the weekend activity is to attract more people, especially the Chinese students, join the church, the church did well at making them feel at home and has been spare vast efforts to providing local Chinese people with a community: a community where love, bravery and concern are shared not just because of religious principle, but the nature of who they are.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Fig 10. In Lecture</b></p> 
<p align="justify"><b>Actions and Reactions</b></p> 
<p align="justify">Before the potluck dinner, the staffs put several white long tables together, on which they put the dishes they had prepared before in a dinning order: appetizers are available at the left side, and then comes the main dishes, entrees and soups; desserts are put at the right side. Families who attend this activity are also encouraged to bring homemade food. The dinner begins at 6:00 pm. Attendees are mostly Chinese students in UO; many of whom ever received help from the church not long enough after they arrived at Eugene and have considered the activity as a routine. All the attendees are required to pray before dinner as a way to express their gratitude and humbleness. Then they can feel free to enjoy the food just like at home. </p> 
<p align="justify">The potluck dinner took around one and a half hour, after which attendees are led by the pastor to the worship room where the music has already begun. Accompanied with the carols, the pastor makes a welcome speech to those newcomers and gives them an opportunity to introduce themselves in public one by one. At the end of the announcement, the pastor calls for a pray and said, "There is nothing that can bring us nearer to God, and lead us deeper into His love, than the work of pray and worship." In order to teach those newcomers how to pray, the senior ones tell them to be still and take the first step by listening to the voice within. </p> 
<p align="justify">The praise of Lord follows as an important part in the activity, with a Deacon chanting hymns and praises as the leading singer. The songs are translated into Chinese, and all attendees follow the pastor and start to learn. However, this is still a problem for those newcomers who never participate in any church activity. Sometimes they get trouble in following the pastor to praise and sing. A projector is used during the worship, by which all the words both in Chinese and English are presented on the curtain. This is done to ensure that it takes a shorter time for those new comers to get involved. </p> 
<p align="justify">Moreover, the church also has prepared many brochures and pastor's cards as gifts for the newcomers, through which Chinese students can have a better understanding about the Chinese church and get the approach for help.  </p>
<p align="justify">Unlike the Bible Study for Seekers held in every Friday night, the third part of the activity on Jan 7 is a lecture about Principles of Cross-Cultural Understanding and Communication in US. DR. Patrick Lucas, the lecturer, who got his PhD degree in Cultural Anthropology at Minzu University of China, has been teaching in China for decades. He makes speeches in Chinese, though he himself is an American. He talked about the challenges of cross-cultural communication and that how to set the personal strategy of the communication problems. This lecture is particular useful for Chinese students who are freaked out by their new life in US.   </p>
