            "content": "h1(all). Chapter I\r\n\r\nh1(all). Getting Started\r\n\r\np(all).. This section will walk you through your first steps towards discovering World of Warcraft\u2019s vast range of mystery and adventure. You will learn all you need to know to dive right into the game, from character creation basics to a handy class selection guide.\r\n\r\np(all).. Your character is your avatar in World of Warcraft. You\u2019re not limited to one character, though; you\u2019re free to create dozens of characters if you want to experience all the  different race and class combinations. Many players refer to their most frequently played character as their \u201cmain\u201d and all other characters as their \u201calts.\u201d Why create more than one character? Since each class plays differently, it\u2019s fun to experiment with other styles of gameplay.\r\n\r\nh2(all).. Step 1: Choose your realm\r\n\r\np. World of Warcraft has millions of active players. If all these players were in the same game world at the same time, things would get more than a little crowded (plus which, the computers unning the game would probably form a workers\u2019 union and go on strike). To keep the gameplay experience stable, smooth, and consistent, World of Warcraft\u2019s population is divided into several different realms. Each realm is an identical copy of the game world, but generally, players from the same realm can only play and interact with each other*. Think of each realm like its own parallel universe or mirror dimension, each home to thousands and thousands of unique player characters.\r\n\r\np. Realms come in four different flavors based on the kind of gameplay experience they offer:\r\n\r\n<table width=\"410\" height=\"380\" border=\"1\">\r\n<tr>\r\n    <td width=\"300\"><p><font size=\"4\"><strong>&nbsp;Normal</strong></font><font size=\"2\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Player Versus Enemies</font><br>\r\n\t&nbsp;The standard. Role-play is optional, and all player-versus-player &nbsp;fights have to be &nbsp;consensual.</td></p>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=\"300\"><p><font size=\"4\"><strong>&nbsp;PvP</strong></font><font size=\"2\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Player Versus Player</font><br>\r\n\t&nbsp;For players who seek out a challenge. Role-play is still optional, &nbsp;but opposite faction players can attack you almost anywhere, &nbsp;and at all times. Be on your guard.</p></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=\"300\"><p><font size=\"4\"><strong>&nbsp;Normal-RP</strong></font><font size=\"2\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Player Versus Enemies \u2013 Role Playing</font><br>\r\n\t&nbsp;On this type of realm, role-play is practically mandatory, but &nbsp;player-versus-player combat still has to be agreed upon by both &nbsp;parties.</p></td>\r\n\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=\"300\"><p><font size=\"4\"><strong>&nbsp;PvP-RP</strong></font><font size=\"2\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Player Versus Player \u2013 Role Playing</font><br>\r\n\t&nbsp;As with regular PvP realms, cross-faction combat is an &nbsp;ever-&nbsp;present threat, and role-play is the norm.</p></td>\r\n\r\n</table>\r\n\r\nh3(all). RECRUIT A FRIEND\r\n\r\n\r\np.If you are planning to play with a friend, make sure to create characters on the same realm so you can adventure together. The Recruit-A-Friend referral system provides considerable in-game nuses to linked friends and family members.\"Visit the Recruit-A-Friend page to learn more about this feature.\":http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&articleId=20588\r\n\r\nh2(all). Step 2: Choose your race\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/static/img/Generation.jpg\" width=\"901\" height=\"556\" class=\"novice\">\r\n\r\np. The original World of Warcraft has eight races to choose from and subsequent expansions increase this number to twelve. Your character\u2019s race determines your overall visual appearance, grants special benefits in the form of racial abilities, and also locks you into one of two factions: Alliance or Horde.\r\n\r\np. Which faction you choose is important because only characters of the same faction can communicate with each other. So, for example, if you created a night elf, that character would only be able to chat and play with the other Alliance characters in the realm. A tauren, on the other hand, could only play with the realm\u2019s other Horde characters.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/static/img/race simple.jpg\"  width=\"463\" height=\"260\" class=\"novice\"><img src=\"/static/img/race simple 2.jpg\" width=\"466\" height=\"260\" class=\"novice\">\r\n\r\nh2(all). Step 3: Choose your class\r\n\r\np.Faction and race are mostly social choices: they determine what your character looks like and who you can interact with. Your choice of class is a gameplay decision: it determines what your character can and can\u2019t do, and what kind of experience you will have playing that character.\r\n\r\np. Not all races can play as all classes; for example, dwarf characters cannot be druids. Generally speaking, your class has a much bigger impact on the way you will experience World of Warcraft, so if the choice comes down to either a specific race or a specific class, pick the class that you prefer.\r\n\r\np. Some classes are designed specifically for one role, while other classes can perform several. The best example for a \u201cpure\u201d healer, for example, is the priest class (although shadow priests are a notable exception), while druids are a good example of a \u201chybrid\u201d class that can effortlessly fill the role of tank, healer, or damage dealer.\r\n\r\nh3. MAIN CLASS ROLES\r\n\r\nh4. TANKS\r\n\r\np. Tanks fight by outlasting their enemies. They are rugged, durable characters that can soak up a lot of damage before they go down. In groups, a tank\u2019s role is to get the monsters to attack him instead of other, more vulnerable members of his group.\r\n\r\nh4. HEALERS\r\n\r\np. Healers have spells and abilities that allow them to quickly regenerate their own health and that of other players. They are especially useful in groups, because even though tanks are as tough as a brick wall, they need healers to keep them alive long enough for the damage dealers to finish the job.\r\n\r\nh4. DAMAGE DEALERS\r\n\r\np. Damage dealers excel at quickly inflicting a lot of damage. Where tanks are marathon runners, damage dealers are sprinters, trying to defeat their targets as quickly as possible while avoiding damage as best they can.\r\n\r\nh2(all). Step 4: Lookin\u2019 Good!\r\n\r\np. Once you\u2019ve picked a race and a class, it\u2019s time to make adjustments to your character\u2019s appearance. Feel free to switch between male and female; the sexes are treated equally in every regard in World of Warcraft, so playing as a man or a woman is a purely cosmetic choice.\r\n\r\np. Each race has additional visual traits you can adjust, such as earrings, tattoos, hair style, and more. You can choose from several different ornate beard styles for a dwarf, for example, or \r\nchoose between horns of varying lengths and shapes for a tauren character. If you\u2019re in a hurry, you can use the \u201crandomize\u201d button to have the game generate a few random configurations until you see one you like, or you can fine-tune your character\u2019s appearance yourself.\r\n\r\np. Lastly, you need to pick a name for your character. Keep in mind that offensive names are not allowed; as a matter of etiquette, please choose an appropriate name. Some names will have already been taken by other players, so explore different name options until you find one you\u2019re happy with.\r\n\r\nh2(all). Step 5: Enter the World of Warcraft\r\n\r\np. Congratulations, you\u2019ve created your first character! Review your choices, and if you\u2019re happy with them, click the button to set foot in a world of mighty heroes and high adventure. Your journey is about to begin\u2026.\r\n\r\np. In other words, your character progresses and gets stronger as you gain experience, new skills, and more powerful items and equipment. Your character\u2019s progress is  automatically stored online, which means that you always pick up right where you left off when you start the game again. In fact, your character\u2019s data can be stored for as long as you want, so you can progress at whatever pace you feel most comfortable  with. Some players blaze through the game\u2019s content at record speed to reach the endgame as quickly as possible, while others prefer to take the time to stop and smell the roses. The choice is entirely up to you.\r\n\r\np. But what\u2019s more, you are not limited to just one character. You can keep a roster of several different characters (currently up to 50), and each character will present you with an entirely different game experience depending on what race and class you choose for them.\r\n\r\nh2. \u2026a world of magic, mystery, and limitless adventure\r\n\r\np. Being a hero sounds great in theory, what with all the glory, fame, fortune, friendly faces in every town, and songs of your epic exploits around every campfire, but what do heroes actually do?\r\n\r\np. Essentially, the core gameplay of World of Warcraft revolves around fighting monsters and completing quests. You will encounter thousands of non-player characters (NPCs), computer-controlled characters who may need your help with tasks ranging from the mundane (such as delivering a letter) to the truly heroic (rescuing a dwarven princess from the evil Dark Iron Clan, for example). More often than not, these quests will put you right in harm\u2019s way, and you\u2019ll find yourself squaring off against deadly monsters. You will be able to deal with most monsters you encounter by ourself, but the true challenges and the big payoffs await in the world\u2019s many dungeons and raids, which can only be conquered by groups of heroes working together as a team.  \r\n\r\np. Another aspect of the life of a hero is the constant struggle between the Alliance and the Horde. Even though there are currently no all-out wars, tensions are high, and small skirmishes regularly take place all over Azeroth where players from both sides fight each other. This is called player-versus-player combat (PvP).\r\n\r\nh2(all). The Road Ahead\r\n\r\np(all). World of Warcraft is a truly massive game. Between the original game, regular patches that add new content, and three full-fledged expansions \u2013 The Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, and Cataclysm \u2013 hundreds of hours of gameplay content await you. We\u2019ve outlined the basics , but only scratched the surface of all that World of Warcraft has to offer.\r\n",

            "content": "h1. Chapter II How to Play\r\n\r\np. World of Warcraft follows one of Blizzard Entertainment\u2019s primary design mantras: Easy to learn, difficult to master. The core gameplay concepts are intuitive and simple by design, so once you\u2019ve picked up on the basics, you\u2019ll be slaughtering monsters and saving princesses in no time. To help you get started, here\u2019s a primer on World of Warcraft gameplay.\r\n\r\nh1(novice). UI Overview\r\n\r\np(novice). This is the main user interface you\u2019ll see while playing World of Warcraft.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/static/img/Main-UI.jpg\" alt=\"quest\" width=\"992\" height=\"557\" class=\"novice\" >\r\n\r\nh1. Your Character\u2019s Abilities\r\n\r\np. In World of Warcraft, you can become a mighty paladin, smiting evil with righteous fury; a sly rogue, sneaking up on an unsuspecting enemy, dagger in hand and poised to strike from the shadows; a brilliant mage, unleashing torrents of destructive arcane energy to wipe out scores of monsters; or even a malevolent death knight, well-versed in the arts of swordplay and necromancy. Whatever class you choose to play, that class is defined by its abilities.\r\n\r\np. Your new character starts out with a few class abilities and you can learn many more over the course of your career. Every class has access to unique abilities that help define its role in the game and shape your experience.\r\n\r\nh1(novice). USING ABILITIES\r\n\r\np(novice). In order to play your character well, you need to know when to use your class abilities. Two factors determine when you can use an ability: cost and cooldown.\r\n\r\np(novice). Each class has a different resource to expend in order to pay the cost of abilities. For example, warriors fuel their abilities with rage, which builds up as they dish out and receive damage. Rogues, on the other hand, are acrobatic fighters and thus do not use rage; instead, they spend energy, which constantly regenerates but limits how quickly they can chain together combat moves. Priests use mana to cast their spells. Mana regenerates slowly while in combat, so priests need to pay attention to how quickly they are burning through their reserves.\r\n\r\np(novice). If an ability has a cooldown, that means that a certain amount of time needs to pass before your character is ready to use that ability again. Cooldowns can last anywhere from a few seconds to half an hour. Abilities with a long cooldown are often very powerful. Used at the right moment, these abilities can be amazingly effective.\r\n\r\nh1. Talents and Glyphs\r\n\r\np. Your character class determines what abilities your character can use, but World of Warcraft provides you with two ways to customize your abilities to create a character with unique strengths.\r\n\r\np. As characters grows stronger, they earn talent points. These points can be spent on talents that let your character specialize in one specific subset of his abilities; for example, mages have access to talent trees that enhance either their frost, fire, or arcane spells.\r\n\r\np. Glyphs provide another method of enhancing your abilities. Characters learn and use glyphs (created by players with the Inscription profession) to make their abilities more powerful or even add new effects to abilities. A character can only equip a limited number of glyphs at a time, so choose carefully.\r\n\r\nh1. Quests\r\n\r\np. Being a hero means performing heroic deeds, and there are plenty of opportunities to do so on Azeroth. Mad deities, rampaging dragons, demonic evils from beyond the stars\u2026 the world is under constant threat, and it\u2019s up to you and your friends to defend your people against these dark, destructive forces. During your life as a hero, you will embark on a series of quests to right what is wrong, to defend the weak and punish the wicked, and to make the world a better, safer place.\r\n\r\n<table width=\"600\" border=\"0\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"/static/img/Quest.jpg\" alt=\"quest\" width=\"458\" height=\"940\" /></td>\r\n    <td> TYPES OF QUESTS\r\n      <p>World of Warcraft offers vast potential for adventure, including access to thousands of different quests. Every quest is unique, but there are some broad categories that you can divide them into\u2026</p>\r\n      <div>\r\n        <div><strong>NORMAL QUEST</strong></div>\r\n        <div>Normal quests are the most common. If your character is experienced enough, you will be able to complete these quests on your own, without the help of other players.</div>\r\n        <div><strong>GROUP QUEST</strong></div>\r\n        <div>Group quests are more challenging than normal quests and usually require a group of heroes to band together, but also offer better rewards. Gather your friends and prepare for battle before attempting one of these quests.</div>\r\n        <div><strong>DUNGEON QUEST</strong></div>\r\n        <div>Dungeon quests require you to delve deep into the dungeons of World of Warcraft, where dangerous and fearsome monsters dwell. You will need a group to complete these quests.</div>\r\n        <div><strong>HEROIC QUEST</strong></div>\r\n        <div>Heroic quests are similar to dungeon quests, but you will have to overcome monsters that are even stronger and more deadly than those found in normal dungeons. Get ready for a tough fight!</div>\r\n        <div><strong>RAID QUEST</strong></div>\r\n        <div>Raid quests are similar to dungeon quests, but you will have to brave the challenges that await in the world&rsquo;s most perilous places. These quests require a large group (10 or 25 players) to complete.</div>\r\n        <div><strong>PLAYER VS PLAYER QUEST</strong></div>\r\n        <div>Player versus player quests will pit you against other players on the field of battle. Will you win glory, honor, and fame, or will you succumb to your enemies&rsquo; relentless attacks? There is only one way to find out\u2026.</div>\r\n        <div><strong>DAILY QUEST</strong></div>\r\n        <div>Daily quests are repeatable quests that you can complete once each day and usually serve to line your pockets with much-needed income and other resources.</div>\r\n    </div></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\nh1. Inventory\r\n\r\np. Just as King Arthur wielded Excalibur, as Roland bore Durandal, and as Achilles donned his god-forged armor, so will you come across magic weapons, armor, and other artifacts of great power. As a matter of fact, you will come across thousands of them; the monsters of Azeroth have a surprising tendency to carry potent magical trinkets with them, ready to be looted off their cooling corpses by aspiring adventurers. But even if the kobold you just sent to the great dark beyond doesn\u2019t have any weapons or armor, he is still sure to carry other items that you can sell for profit. This collection of items you\u2019re lugging around with you at any given time is called your inventory.\r\n\r\nh1(novice). YOUR BACKPACK AND BAGS\r\n\r\np(novice). Your character begins the game with a simple backpack. It can only hold a limited number of things, but you can significantly increase the number of items you can pick up by carrying additional bags.\r\n\r\nh1(novice). THE BANK\r\n\r\np(novice). Every major city in World of Warcraft also has a bank where you can store your items. If you run out of room in your backpack and bags, you can visit a bank and stash away any items you don\u2019t need right now. Even better, all banks are magically connected, so you can store items in one bank and retrieve them at another!\r\n\r\nh1(novice). THE AUCTION HOUSE\r\n\r\np(novice). Right across from most banks you\u2019re likely to find an auction house. Players can buy and sell items from those auction houses, and some players even find ways to turn the auction house into a reliable source of income. Who says that the hero business can\u2019t be profitable? You can put your own items up for auction, and you can browse what other auctions are currently going on. If you are looking for a specific item, or if you have a valuable item that you don\u2019t need, the auction house should be your first stop.\r\n\r\nh1(novice). How To Make Friends And Influence People\r\n\r\np(novice). At its core, what makes World of Warcraft such a fun game is that you share this world with thousands of other players at the same time. You can experience the majority of the game\u2019s content by yourself if you wish, but chatting with other players, forming groups, joining guilds, and most importantly, making friends is essential if you want to get the most out of World of Warcraft.\r\n\r\nh1(novice). CHAT\r\n\r\np(novice). World of Warcraft includes a sophisticated chat system that allows you to talk to other players either in writing or, if you are in a group with other players, via voice chat. You can manage all your chat channels via the game\u2019s comprehensive chat interface. You can set up private channels if you want to talk to your friends only, or you can chat in the local/global chat channels if you want to reach a larger audience, and if you are in a guild you have access to your guild\u2019s own chat channel. The only limitation to chat in World of Warcraft, really, is chat across factions; you cannot communicate with players of the opposite faction.\r\n\r\nh1(novice). GROUPS\r\n\r\np(novice). You will eventually want to band together with other players to tackle a difficult quest or venture into one of the world\u2019s many dungeons. You can either form your own group by inviting other players, join someone else\u2019s group upon request, or you can use the game\u2019s Dungeon Finder tool to automatically join a group for a specific dungeon via the game\u2019s matchmaking service. Groups are limited to five players, but you can also form a raid group, which can include up to 40 people.\r\n\r\nh1(novice). GUILDS\r\n\r\np(novice). Groups and raids are always temporary and cease to exist once all members leave or log off. Guilds, on the other hand, are permanent and much larger groups of players united under one banner to help each other and play the game together. Being in a guild has a few advantages; you have your own guild chat channel, you can use a shared guild bank, and guilds can earn a number of cool guild achievements and bonuses by braving certain challenges. You can either ask to join a guild, or you and your friends can form your own.\r\n\r\nh1(novice). FRIENDS\r\n\r\np(novice). As you chat, form groups and raids, join guilds, and play together with others, you will meet other players who are genuinely good company and with whom you\u2019d like to play more often. You should add those players to your Friends List, which allows you to keep track of your favorite players, see when they\u2019re online, and where they are in World of Warcraft when they are logged in.\r\n",

            "content": "h1. What Is World of Warcraft\r\n\r\np. What is World of Warcraft? World of Warcraft is an online game where players from around the world assume the roles of heroic fantasy characters and explore a virtual world full of mystery, magic, and endless adventure. So much for the short answer! If you\u2019re still looking for a better understanding of what World of Warcraft is, this page and the Beginner\u2019s Guide are the right place to start.\r\n\r\np. So, what is this game? Among other things,\r\n\r\np. World of Warcraft is\u2026\r\n\r\nh2. \u2026a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game\r\n\r\np(novice). Games in the same genre as World of Warcraft are commonly referred to as MMORPGs, which stands for \u201cMassively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game.\u201d\r\n\r\nh3(novice). MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER\r\n\r\np(novice). Most multiplayer games can accommodate anywhere from two up to several dozen simultaneous players in a game. Massively multiplayer games, however, can have thousands of players in the same game world at the same time, interacting with each other. They are, as the name suggests, massive.\r\n\r\nh3(novice). ONLINE\r\n\r\np(novice). Unlike most games, MMORPGs do not have an offline mode you need to be connected to the Internet while you play. This doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t enjoy these games alone. World of Warcraft offers plenty of content to players who want to go it solo. But since you share a virtual world with other \r\nplayers, you need to be connected to the Internet to join in the fun. Much of the game\u2019s advanced content is geared towards groups of players working together to explore dangerous dungeons and defeat powerful monsters.\r\n\r\nh3(novice). ROLE-PLAYING\r\n\r\np(novice). In World of Warcraft, each player character has a specific set of skills and abilities that define that character\u2019s role. For example, mages are powerful spellcasters who use magic to inflict damage on their enemies from afar but are very vulnerable to attacks. These traits define the role of the mage: hang back, do a ton of damage, and hope to kill the monsters before they reach you.\r\n \r\np(novice). In a group context, there are three main roles: tank, damage dealer, and healer. A warrior can choose to serve as a formidable \u201ctank,\u201d or protector. Tanks are resilient, and it\u2019s their job to draw the enemy\u2019s attention away from the more vulnerable members of the group. The aforementioned mages make excellent damage dealers. A priest specialized in healing powers may not do as much damage as other classes, but they can play a vital role, keeping the party alive with healing magic. It\u2019s important to note that all classes, regardless of which role they perform, are able to play solo. Some classes are limited in the kind of role they can play: \r\n warlocks and rogues, for instance, are strictly damage dealers. Some character \r\n classes, like the druid, can capably fulfill all three roles.\r\n \r\np(novice). Role-play also means that you play the role of a character living in the game\u2019s fantasy world. How much or how little you role-play is up to you; some players construct entire background histories for their characters and adopt unique mannerisms when they\u2019re \u201cin character.\u201d Immersing yourself completely in the fantasy can be a lot of fun, but tastes vary, and it\u2019s perfectly alright if full immersion simply isn\u2019t your style. This kind of role-play is purely optional, and we provide separate \r\n Role-Play realms for those who prefer to play in an immersive world.\r\n \r\np(novice). To summarize: In an MMORPG, you play the role of a unique character in a persistent \r\nonline world shared by thousands of other players.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. \u2026set in the high-fantasy universe of Warcraft\r\n\r\np(novice). Before World of Warcraft, there was the Warcraft series of strategy games. World of Warcraft is set in the same high-fantasy universe as the previous Warcraft games, and it builds on and expands a legacy of more than fifteen years of epic storytelling.\r\n\r\np(novice). Azeroth is a world of swords and sorcery. Its lands are home to a vast number of races and cultures, led by kings, chieftains, lords, ladies, archdruids, and everything in between. Some of Azeroth\u2019s people share bonds of friendship reaching back thousands of years;\r\n others are sworn enemies with long histories of bitter hatred. Among all these different kingdoms, cultures, tribes, and territories, two major power blocs are locked in a struggle for dominance.\r\n \r\np(novice). Epic as they may be, these wars between the mortal races pale in comparison to the malevolent forces threatening Azeroth from within and without. Deep beneath the surface of Azeroth, the terrible Old Gods mastermind the release of untold horrors upon the world; in the frozen wastes of the northern continent, a being of pure evil commands a vast army of undeath, ready to snuff out all life; and far across the stars, deep within the warped realm of the Twisting Nether, an unstoppable force of chaos and destruction thirsts to lead its demonic legion to Azeroth and to put the world to the flame.\r\n \r\np(novice). World of Warcraft thrusts you into a central role of an ever-changing story. You and your friends will be active participants in events that are steeped in the rich lore of this fantasy universe. Fight for either the Alliance or the Horde, and experience a fully-realized fantasy world.\r\n \r\nh2. \u2026centered around persistent online personae\r\n\r\np(novice). In World of Warcraft, you play the role of a fantasy hero. Over the course of his or her life, your character will brave thousands of quests, learn new and powerful abilities, amass (and likely spend) vast fortunes of gold, and find hundreds of powerful weapons, enchanted rings, artifacts, suits of armor, and more.\r\n\r\np(novice). In other words, your character progresses and gets stronger as you gain experience, new skills, and more powerful items and equipment. Your character\u2019s progress is automatically stored online, which means that you always pick up right where you left off when you start the game again. In fact, your character\u2019s data can be stored for as long as you want, so you can progress at whatever pace you feel most comfortable with. Some players blaze through the game\u2019s content at record speed to reach the endgame as quickly as possible, while others prefer to take the time to stop and smell the roses. The choice is entirely up to you.\r\n \r\np(novice). But what\u2019s more, you are not limited to just one character. You can keep a roster \r\nof several different characters (currently up to 50), and each character will present\r\n you with an entirely different game experience depending on what race and class you \r\n choose for them.\r\n\r\nh2. \u2026a world of magic, mystery, and limitless adventure \r\n\r\np(novice). Being a hero sounds great in theory, what with all the glory, fame, fortune, friendly faces in every town, and songs of your epic exploits around every campfire, but what do heroes actually do?\r\n\r\np(novice). Essentially, the core gameplay of World of Warcraft revolves around fighting monsters and completing quests. You will encounter thousands of non-player characters (NPCs), computer-controlled characters who may need your help with tasks ranging from the mundane (such as delivering a letter) to the truly heroic (rescuing a dwarven princess from the evil Dark Iron Clan, for example). More often than not, these quests will put you right in harm\u2019s way, and you\u2019ll find yourself squaring off against deadly monsters. You will be able to deal with most monsters you encounter by yourself, but the true challenges and the big payoffs await in the world\u2019s many dungeons and raids, which can only be conquered by groups of heroes working together as a team.\r\n \r\np(novice). Another aspect of the life of a hero is the constant struggle between the Alliance and the Horde. Even though there are currently no all-out wars, tensions are high, and small skirmishes regularly take place all over Azeroth where players from both sides fight each other. This is called player-versus-player combat (PvP).\r\n\r\nh2. The Road Ahead \r\n\r\np. World of Warcraft is a truly massive game. Between the original game, regular patches that add new content, and three full-fledged expansions \u2013 The Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, and Cataclysm \u2013 hundreds of hours of gameplay content await you. We\u2019ve outlined the basics , but only scratched the surface of all that World of Warcraft has to offer.",

This new and improved class guide contains more information about each of World of Warcraft\u2019s classes with a description of their abilities, playstyles, and history in the world of Azeroth.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/static/img/class simple.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"603\" height=\"442\" class=\"novice\">\r\n\r\nh1. Paladin\r\n\r\np(novice). This is the call of the paladin: to protect the weak, to bring justice to the unjust, and to vanquish evil from the darkest corners of the world. These holy warriors are equipped with plate armor so they can confront the toughest of foes, and the blessing of the Light allows them to heal wounds and, in some cases, even restore life to the dead.\r\n\r\np(novice). Ready to serve, paladins can defend their allies with sword and shield, or they can wield massive two-handed weapons against their enemies. The Light grants paladins additional power against the undead and demons, ensuring that these profane beings corrupt the world no longer.\r\n\r\np(novice). Paladins are not only zealots, but also guardians of the righteous, and they bestow blessings on those the Light would shine upon. The Light radiates from paladins, and worthy allies who stand near them are emboldened by its power.\r\n\r\nh1. Shaman\r\n\r\np(novice). Shaman are spiritual guides and practitioners, not of the divine, but of the very elements. Unlike some other mystics, shaman commune with forces that are not strictly benevolent. The elements are chaotic, and left to their own devices, they rage against one another in unending primal fury. It is the call of the shaman to bring balance to this chaos. Acting as moderators among earth, fire, water, and air, shaman summon totems that focus the elements to support the shaman\u2019s allies or punish those who threaten them.\r\n\r\np(novice). These masters of the elements can also call upon elemental forces directly, unleashing torrents of lava and bolts of lightning against foes. The elements can create, destroy, support, and hinder.\r\n\r\np(novice). The experienced shaman balances the vast spectrum of these primordial forces into an array of diverse abilities, making shaman versatile heroes and valued members of any group.\r\n\r\n<table class=\"expert\" width=\"770\" border=\"1\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"><div align=\"center\">Attributes</div></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"><div align=\"center\">Priest</div></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"><div align=\"center\">Rogue</div></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"><div align=\"center\">Warrior</div></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"><div align=\"center\">Mage</div></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"><div align=\"center\">Druid</div></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"><div align=\"center\">Hunter</div></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"><div align=\"center\">Warlock</div></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"><div align=\"center\">Shaman</div></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"><div align=\"center\">Paladin</div></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"><div align=\"center\">Death Knight</div></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">Strength</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+1</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+3</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+1</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+1</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+2</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+88</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">Agility</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+3</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+1</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+1</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+1</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+2</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+79</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">Stamina</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+1</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"> +2</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+1</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+1</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+1</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+2</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+79</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">Intellect</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+2</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+3</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+2</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+2</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+1</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+9</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">Spirit</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+3</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\"></td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+2</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+2</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+1</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+2</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+2</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+1</td>\r\n    <td width=\"70\">+22</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n",

            "content": "h1. Races\r\n\r\np. Azeroth is home to dozens of unique and interesting races. In this section, you will be able to learn more about the background of the game\u2019s playable races, their homelands, and much more.\r\n\r\nh1. Orc\r\n\r\np(novice). Unlike the other races of the Horde, orcs are not native to Azeroth. Initially, they lived as shamanic clans on the lush world of Draenor. They abandoned their peaceful culture when Kil\u2019jaeden, a demon lord of the Burning Legion, corrupted the orcs and used them in his vengeful plot against the draenei, who were exiles from Kil\u2019jaeden\u2019s homeworld.\r\n\r\np(novice). Because of the demons\u2019 manipulation, most of the orc chieftains drank the blood of a Burning Legion pit lord, Mannoroth the Destructor. This act infused the orcs with power, but at a great price: they were now enslaved to the Legion. Constant exposure to fel energies turned the orcs\u2019 naturally brown skin to a sickly green, and the orcs\u2019 usage of fel magic caused their ancestral lands to wither and die.\r\n\r\np(novice). As Kil\u2019jaeden had planned, the orcs succeeded in killing most of the draenei population. Now Kil\u2019jaeden was ready to test the orcs\u2019 effectiveness against another old enemy. Thousands of years before, the demons had launched an invasion of Azeroth that had ultimately failed, but this time the orcs could fight in the Legion\u2019s stead. To that end, the corrupted human archmage Medivh contacted the orc warlock Gul\u2019dan. Together they constructed the Dark Portal, which allowed the orcs to travel to Azeroth.\r\n\r\np(novice). After their arrival, the orcs crushed the unsuspecting human kingdom of Stormwind. The mighty orc armies, known as the Horde, then pressed north through the Eastern Kingdoms, and their victory was nearly assured for a time. Eventually, however, internal conflicts resulted in the orcs\u2019 defeat, and those who did not die in battle were rounded up and placed in internment camps. But a young slave named Thrall managed to escape from captivity and join a liberation force consisting of Warchief Orgrim Doomhammer and other free orcs. When Doomhammer fell in combat, Thrall became the new warchief of the Horde and the inheritor of Doomhammer\u2019s namesake weapon.\r\n\r\np(novice). Thrall and his people later journeyed across the sea to the distant continent of Kalimdor. Within the forests of Ashenvale, the warchief and his mentor, Grommash Hellscream, confronted Mannoroth. In the end, Grom gave his life to kill the pit lord and remove the blood-curse from the orcs forever. A new chapter began for the orcs: war was no longer the driving focus of their culture, and they settled the land along Kalimdor\u2019s eastern coastline, which Thrall named Durotar.\r\n\r\np(novice). Years later, the warchief and many others returned to the remnants of Draenor, now known as Outland, to prevent another attack from the Burning Legion. There Thrall met Garrosh, son of Grom Hellscream, and convinced him to join the Horde and return to Azeroth as an advisor. Garrosh was a leading commander during the battles against the Lich King in Northrend, and also gained popularity for his fiery personality.\r\n\r\np(novice). In addition to his commitments as leader of the Horde, Thrall was a dedicated shaman with close ties to the elements. When he noticed severe disturbances in the elemental spirits, Thrall knew that he had to step down as warchief in order to investigate the situation lest all of Azeroth fall into chaos. Given his options, Thrall believed that Garrosh was the clear choice for warchief. But the impulsive young Hellscream is much more aggressive than his diplomatic predecessor. With the equally tempestuous King Varian Wrynn back on the throne of Stormwind, it seems likely that the orcs will need their famed strength now more than ever.\r\n\r\nh3. Start Location:Durotar\r\n\r\np(novice). The dry, harsh land of Durotar is home to some of the toughest creatures on Azeroth. Unwary travelers may fall prey to venomous scorpids, ferocious crocolisks, or angry quilboar. Thrall chose to settle this inhospitable area after the Third War as penance for the orcs\u2019 past transgressions. He named the land after his father, Durotan, former chieftain of the Frostwolf clan. Following the Cataclysm, many of the orcish settlements were flooded or destroyed, and the Northwatch soldiers at Tiragarde Keep have become more aggressive than ever. As relations worsen between the Alliance and the Horde, it is essential that the orcs contain these threats swiftly to ensure the survival of their people.\r\n\r\nh3. Home City:Orgrimmar\r\n\r\np(novice). Named for the former Horde warchief Orgrim Doomhammer, this capital was rapidly constructed when the orcs first settled in Durotar. Garrosh Hellscream has recently rebuilt most of the city\u2019s architecture, and now Orgrimmar\u2019s fortresses rank among the most imposing on Azeroth. Spiked metal towers line the city\u2019s streets, and the red-and-black banners of the Horde wave from every post. Most of the various races have separated into their own districts, from the tauren in the Valley of Wisdom to the trolls in the Valley of Spirits. Grommash Hold towers over all else, allowing Garrosh Hellscream to keep a close watch on his people.\r\n\r\nh3. Racial Mount:Wolf\r\n\r\np(novice). Long ago, the orcs tamed the large and swift wolves of Draenor. These massive canines came to be the orcs\u2019 chosen companions as well as their favored method of transportation. The wolves\u2019 unflinching temperament made them especially well-suited for battling large prey. When the orcs became more warlike and invaded Azeroth, their wolves were bred for size and stamina so they could bear armored riders into battle. Dire wolves remain the favored mounts for orc fighters and can be purchased in the Valley of Honor in Orgrimmar.\r\n\r\nh3. Leader:Garrosh Hellscream Warchief of the Horde\r\n\r\np(novice). Garrosh grew up on Draenor in the shadow of his father, the great warrior Grommash Hellscream. Chieftain of the Warsong clan, Grom was the first orc leader to drink the blood of Mannoroth, subjugating the orcs to the Legion\u2019s will. Before this event, Garrosh was among several orcs who had become ill with the red pox. They had been quarantined far away in Nagrand, allowing them to escape the demonic corruption. The younger Hellscream was ashamed of his father for many years until he met Thrall and learned of Grom\u2019s heroic redemption. Garrosh has since embraced his potential as a strong leader, most notably in Northrend, where he directed the Horde advance through the Borean Tundra and won the hearts of his people. Uncompromising and fiercely proud, Hellscream intends to restore the orcs\u2019 glory by any means necessary.\r\n\r\nh1. Human\r\n\r\np(novice). Recent discoveries have shown that humans are descended from the barbaric vrykul, half-giant warriors who live in Northrend. Early humans were primarily a scattered and tribal people for several millennia, until the rising strength of the troll empire forced their strategic unification. Thus the nation of Arathor was formed, along with its capital, the city-state of Strom.\r\n\r\np(novice). After several centuries of peace, however, the increasingly prosperous and independent city-states of Arathor split into separate kingdoms: Gilneas to the west, Alterac, Dalaran, and Lordaeron to the northwest, Kul Tiras to the southwest, and Stormwind to the far south. Strom itself was renamed Stromgarde and remained a significantly powerful kingdom.\r\n\r\np(novice). But disaster struck when the orcish Horde appeared on Azeroth, reducing Stormwind to ruins during the First War between orcs and humans. The city\u2019s survivors, including the young prince, Varian Wrynn, fled to Lordaeron, where the leaders of the seven kingdoms resolved to unify once again in the Alliance of Lordaeron. Joined together, they succeeded in defeating the Horde during the Second War.\r\n\r\np(novice). Tensions grew among the kingdoms, however, as the costs for maintaining the Alliance rose much higher than originally anticipated. Unwilling to pay the taxes, the leaders of Gilneas and Stromgarde chose to withdraw their kingdoms from the Alliance. Further disaster came when the kingdom of Lordaeron was decimated by a mysterious plague that killed thousands of humans and converted them into undead servants of the Lich King. Even Lordaeron\u2019s prince, Arthas Menethil, was manipulated by the Lich King, leading Arthas to kill his own father and journey to Northrend, where he merged with his master. For the next five years, the Lich King remained in Northrend, plotting and building up his armies.\r\n\r\np(novice). But unleashing the plague of undeath was merely preparation for an invasion by the demonic Burning Legion, which had long sought to destroy all life on Azeroth. When the Legion struck, humans banded together with other races and secured a costly victory during the Third War. Recently, members of the Horde and the Alliance launched separate campaigns in Northrend, and their efforts resulted in the Lich King\u2019s crushing defeat.\r\n\r\np(novice). Since the fall of Lordaeron, the kingdom of Stormwind has become the strongest bastion of humanity and the most powerful force in the now multiracial Alliance. Led by King Varian Wrynn, the people of Stormwind hold fast to the principles of honor and justice as they defend their settlements and their families.\r\n\r\np(novice). Though humans are among the younger races on Azeroth, they have faced many challenges with fortitude and resilience. Their continued ability to adapt and rebuild has made them a vital force in an ever-changing world.\r\n\r\nh3. Start Location:Elwynn Forest\r\n\r\np(novice). The peaceful woodlands to the south of Stormwind City seem more tranquil than ever since the fall of the Defias Brotherhood, but the inhabitants of Elwynn Forest are hardly idle. There are fields to sow, mines to work, and lumber to harvest. For all its pomp and grandeur, Stormwind wouldn\u2019t last long without a constant stream of food and supplies to support the city\u2019s population. This exchange has become increasingly threatened by kobold invasions, vicious feuds among farmers, and attacks from wild animals. Northshire Abbey remains dedicated to recruiting and training any adventurers brave enough to help keep the peace. Likewise, the Blackrock orcs are gathering their forces in the nearby Redridge Mountains. With Stormwind\u2019s militia stretched thinner than ever, these renegade orcs stand ready to finally annihilate their old human enemies in Elwynn Forest.\r\n\r\nh3. Home City:Stormwind City\r\n\r\np(novice). No city better demonstrates human determination than Stormwind. Destroyed during the Horde\u2019s initial invasion of Azeroth, Stormwind was painstakingly reconstructed by the Stonemasons\u2019 Guild after the Second War. Parts of the city were razed again when Deathwing, the corrupted black Dragon Aspect, brutally attacked Stormwind, but the other undamaged districts are more beautiful than ever thanks to their hardworking inhabitants. From the magnificent Cathedral of Light, which serves as a major spiritual hub, to the awe-inspiring Valley of Heroes, which commemorates the sacrifices of Stormwind\u2019s loyal champions, the city truly represents the courageous heart of humanity.\r\n\r\nh3. Racial Mount:Horse\r\n\r\np(novice). These trusty steeds have carried their human masters to battle since before the First War. Known for their swiftness and spirited temperaments, these mounts are perfectly suited for their heroic riders. The Evendales of Elwynn Forest are especially prized by adventurers for their loyalty and steadiness in the face of danger. Due to their overwhelming popularity, these horses can also be found in Theramore and even the Wetlands.\r\n\r\nh3. Leader:King Varian Wrynn\r\n\r\np(novice). Varian\u2019s life has been defined by tragedy and conflict. The murder of his father by the assassin Garona Halforcen weighs heavily on him, along with the accidental death of his wife, Tiffin, during a riot. The king has recently returned to the throne following his abduction by the Defias Brotherhood and the black dragon Onyxia, who disguised herself as Lady Katrana Prestor. Robbed of his memories and enslaved by a Horde gladiatorial trainer in Kalimdor, Varian fought his way to freedom, earning the nickname \u201cLo\u2019Gosh,\u201d or \u201cghost wolf,\u201d while in battle. With the help of his comrades, he was able to recover his true identity and finally defeat Prestor. Known for his tenacity and fierce will, King Varian Wrynn is committed to protecting the Alliance\u2019s interests and raising his son, Anduin, to follow in his place.\r\n\r\n<table width=\"800\"
