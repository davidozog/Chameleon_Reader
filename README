To set up the development server:

  0. Assure you have an up to date Python version installed
  1. Install Django
       link:  
             https://www.djangoproject.com/download/
       commands:
             cd <your/download/location>
             python setup.py install
  2. Install django-registration 
       link:  
             https://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/downloads
       command:
             cd <your/download/location>
             python setup.py install
  3. Install django-mptt
       link:  
             https://github.com/django-mptt/django-mptt/  
       command:
             cd <your/download/location>
             python setup.py install
  4. Install textile
       link:
             http://pypi.python.org/pypi/textile
       command:
             cd <your/download/location>
             python setup.py install
       Note:
       		You might need to install setuptools at this step, which can be 
       		found at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#files, and you'll
       		need to download the tar.gz file
  5. Setup your database (either postgresql, sqlite3, mysql, etc...)
       * Install
       * Start the server
       * add database
       * NOTE: On Macs, sqlite3 is probably installed by default and is a good choice
  6. Change settings.py
	   * Change PREFIX. Remember to put a '/' after your path, like this:
	     '/Users/YZ/Sites/Chameleon_Reader/'.
	   * Change USER to your user name.
	   * Change DATABASES setting. (Unfinished. Need David's input)
	   * Change TIME_ZONE to 'America/Vancouver'.  This is not required though.
	   * Change ROOT_URLCONF to 'Chameleon_Reader.urls'.
  7. Initialize database
  	   * Command: python manage.py syncdb.
  	   * Note: (David, it asks me to create a superuser at this step. 
  	   			What should I do?  I chosed no.)
  8. Run server
  	   * Command: python manage.py runserver
